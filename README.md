# SmoothStreamsTV-playlist
Generate a M3U8 playlist (for VLC, Mplayer, etc.) from your command line.

###### Tested on: Mac OS X 10.11; macOS 10.12; Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS; Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS


## Requirements

* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)

I've made an effort to use only built-in Python modules, but please let me know if your system requires any extra items installed to make this work.


## Instructions

1. [Download](https://github.com/stvhwrd/SmoothStreamsTV-playlist/archive/master.zip) this repository.
`wget -O SmoothStreamsTV-playlist https://github.com/stvhwrd/SmoothStreamsTV-playlist/archive/master.zip`

2. Unzip the zip file.
`unzip SmoothStreamsTV-playlist`

3. Navigate to the folder.
`cd SmoothStreamsTV-playlist`

4. Run the script **with Python 2**.
`python ./sstv-playlist.py`

The m3u8 playlist file will be created in the same directory as the script itself.
If you wish, you can move the `sstv-playlist.py` file alone to any directory, and the m3u8 playlist file will be created there instead.


## Feedback

If you have any issues with the program, please be sure to [open an Issue](https://github.com/stvhwrd/SmoothStreamsTV-playlist/issues/new) on GitHub, so that it can be tracked and addressed formally.

A few people have sent me emails, and while I *really* appreciate the feedback, emails can get lost or buried.
GitHub Issues will stick with the project, and are the best way to ensure that the issue is resolved.

Thank you to everyone who gave me feedback on the first iteration of this project!  Please Star or Watch the repo to stay updated.
