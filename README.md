# SmoothStreamsTV-playlist
Generate a M3U8 playlist (for VLC, MPC, MPlayer, etc.) for [SmoothStreamsTV](http://smoothstreams.tv/) from your command line.


## Requirements

* [Python 2.7.10<sup>+<sup>](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)

I've made an effort to use only built-in Python modules, but please let me know if your system requires any extra items installed to make this work.


## Instructions

1. [Download](https://github.com/stvhwrd/SmoothStreamsTV-playlist/archive/master.zip) this repository.

2. Unzip the zip file.

3. Open the folder.

4. Run the script with **Python 2**:  `python ./sstv-playlist.py`


## Result

The m3u8 playlist file will be created in the directory that the script is **called from**.

For example, if you are in your home directory,
```bash
$ cd ~
```

and call the script in your `~/Scripts` directory,
```bash
$ python ~/Scripts/sstv-playlist.py
```

the script will be created in your home directory.
```bash
$ ls ~

  SmoothStreamsTV.m3u8
```

A few people have sent me emails, and while I *really* appreciate the feedback, emails can get lost or buried.
GitHub Issues will stick with the project, and are the best way to ensure that the issue is resolved.
