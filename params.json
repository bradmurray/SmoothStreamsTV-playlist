  "body": "## Requirements\r\n\r\n* [Python 2.7.10<sup>+<sup>](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)\r\n\r\nI've made an effort to use only built-in Python modules, but please let me know if your system requires any extra items installed to make this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\n1. [Download](https://github.com/stvhwrd/SmoothStreamsTV-playlist/archive/master.zip) this repository.\r\n\r\n2. Unzip the zip file.\r\n\r\n3. Open the folder.\r\n\r\n4. Run the script with **Python 2**:\r\n\r\n`python ./sstv-playlist.py`\r\n\r\nThe m3u8 playlist file will be created in the same directory as the script itself.\r\nIf you wish, you can move the `sstv-playlist.py` file alone to any directory, and the m3u8 playlist file will be created there instead.\r\n\r\n## Python 3\r\n\r\nI will only be maintaining one version of the script, but I will endeavour to keep using a `2to3` compatible syntax and style.\r\n\r\nYou can use the [2to3](https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/2to3.html) translation utility included with most (if not all) Python installations to automagically convert the script to a Python3 version with the command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2to3 -w sstv-playlist.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What does this do?\r\n* backs up the original `sstv-playlist.py` to `sstv-playlist.py.bak`\r\n* converts `sstv-playlist.py` from a Python2-compatibile script to a Python3-compatible script.\r\n\r\nYou can run the resulting script with the command: `python3 sstv-playlist.py`\r\n\r\n\r\n(Tested with 2to3 from Python 2.7.12 on macOS 10.12)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n#### Tested on: \r\n* Mac OS X 10.11\r\n* macOS 10.12\r\n* Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS\r\n* Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS\r\n* Windows 7\r\n* Windows 10\r\n\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you have any issues with the program, please be sure to [open an Issue](https://github.com/stvhwrd/SmoothStreamsTV-playlist/issues/new) on GitHub, so that it can be tracked and addressed formally.\r\n\r\nA few people have sent me emails, and while I *really* appreciate the feedback, emails can get lost or buried.\r\nGitHub Issues will stick with the project, and are the best way to ensure that the issue is resolved.\r\n\r\nThank you to everyone who gave me feedback on the first iteration of this project!  Please Star or Watch the repo to stay updated.\r\n",
