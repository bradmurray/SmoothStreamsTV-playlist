  "body": "# SSTV-playlist\r\nGenerate a M3U8 playlist from an authenticated [SmoothStreamsTV URL](http://streamtvnow.tv/players/web_auth_old/index.php).  No affiliation with SmoothStreamsTV or StreamTVNow.\r\n\r\nThis program will output an M3U8 playlist file when fed an authenticated URL.  \r\n\r\n## Note: Authentication tokens expire every 24 hours, so this will have to be run once per day to generate a valid playlist.  For those with some scripting/programming ability, this should be trivial.\r\n\r\nIt simply extracts the auth token from the authenticated URL and inserts it into an m3u8 template with the channel names/URLs from StreamTVNow.\r\n\r\n## Why did I build this?\r\n\r\n\r\n![VLC rules](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/VLC_Icon.svg/200px-VLC_Icon.svg.png)\r\n#### Because [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/) is my favourite media player.\r\n...and it plays nicely with M3U8 playlists, including playlists of HLS streams.\r\n\r\n## How do I use this?\r\n\r\n#### 1. Sign in to your account on [StreamTVNow](http://streamtvnow.tv).\r\n\r\n#### 2. Go to the [\"old\" player page](http://streamtvnow.tv/players/web_auth_old/index.php).\r\n\r\n#### 3. Click on the VLC traffic cone icon, below the video player frame.\r\n\r\n![VLC cone icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stvhwrd/SmoothStreamsTV-playlist/master/images/click-on-vlc.png)\r\n\r\n#### 4. Highlight and copy the link that appears beside the **HLS** box.\r\n\r\n![Copy URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stvhwrd/SmoothStreamsTV-playlist/master/images/copy-URL.png)\r\n\r\n#### 5. Open a terminal (AKA command line) and run the python script.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ncd /path/to/the/script\r\npython ./sstv-playlist-generator.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Run the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stvhwrd/SmoothStreamsTV-playlist/master/images/run-script.png)\r\n\r\n#### 6. Paste the URL from your clipboard into the terminal window.\r\n\r\n![Paste the URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stvhwrd/SmoothStreamsTV-playlist/master/images/paste-URL.png)\r\n\r\n#### 7. Playlist is built and placed in the same folder as the script.\r\n\r\n![Success](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stvhwrd/SmoothStreamsTV-playlist/master/images/success.png)\r\n\r\n#### 8. Navigate to that folder and open the m3u8 file in VLC by drag-and-drop or right click.\r\n\r\n![Open playlist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stvhwrd/SmoothStreamsTV-playlist/master/images/open-playlist.png)\r\n\r\nYou'll now see the list of channels available in VLC's playlist.\r\n\r\n![List of channels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stvhwrd/SmoothStreamsTV-playlist/master/images/channel-list.png)\r\n\r\nDouble-click one to begin playing in VLC.\r\n\r\n![Playing in VLC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stvhwrd/SmoothStreamsTV-playlist/master/images/vlc.png)\r\n\r\n## That's all!\r\n\r\n#### Please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/stvhwrd/SmoothStreamsTV-playlist/issues) or contribute some improvements!\r\n",
